# Pomodoro App

A simple, visually appealing Pomodoro timer web application to help you manage your focus sessions using the Pomodoro Technique.

## Overview

The **Pomodoro App** is a productivity tool that implements the Pomodoro Technique—a time management method that uses focused work sessions (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. This app features a clean UI, a circular timer visualization, and interactive controls for starting, pausing, and resetting your session.
